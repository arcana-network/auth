# What is Wallet SDK?

You can integrate your application with Arcana Network Wallet SDK to securely sign blockchain transactions and easily onboard application users. Wallet SDK can be used to enable one or more authentication mechanisms. After authentication, each user is internally assigned a unique key that is secure, private and never exposed. Application users don't need to manage keys or share them explicitly for enabling any blockchain transaction. At the same time, application users get complete flexiblity to choose the way they onboard a dApp using familiar Web2 signup/login mechanisms configured by the application developer.

Wallet SDK abstracts user onboarding features of [Auth SDK](https://github.com/arcana-network/auth) with a difference.  It does not expose any key associated with the user but enables secure [Ethereum provider](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193) for dApps. If the dApp requires to provide blockchain enabled secure and private file storage and access functionality, Wallet SDK seamlessly works with [Storage SDK](https://github.com/arcana-network/storage) to enable file based transaction signing and approval by the user.

If your application use case requires you to have a **secure, private file store for user data** while managing your own keys, or using your own wallet, or a third party wallet, then you can directly integrate your application with Storage SDK. Otherwise, it is recommended that you use Wallet SDK and Storage SDK together for a seamless experience.  

Following authentication mechanisms are supported:

* Social OAuth
  - Discord
  - GitHub
  - Google
  - Reddit
  - Twitter
  - Twitch
* Passwordless authentication
